# ProfilerImpl

This code represents a concrete implementation of the Profiler interface. It uses a Clock object for timing and a ProfilingState object to store the profile data.

The ProfilerImpl class has
- a Clock object as a parameter. This object is used for timing the execution of methods that are profiled.
- The state object is an instance of ProfilingState that is used to keep track of the profile data.
- The startTime variable is a ZonedDateTime that represents the start time of the profiling.
```java
final class ProfilerImpl implements Profiler {
  private final Clock clock;
  private final ProfilingState state = new ProfilingState();
  private final ZonedDateTime startTime;

  @Inject
  ProfilerImpl(Clock clock) {
    this.clock = Objects.requireNonNull(clock);
    this.startTime = ZonedDateTime.now(clock);
  }

```

The wrap method takes a class object and an object of that class as parameters, and returns a dynamically generated proxy object that wraps the original object. This proxy object is generated using the java.lang.reflect.Proxy class. The ProfilingMethodInterceptor is passed to the Proxy.newProxyInstance method as the invocation handler, and it intercepts method calls to the original object, recording profiling data for each method call.

```java
@Override
  public <T> T wrap(Class<T> klass, T delegate) {
    Objects.requireNonNull(klass);

    Method[] methods = klass.getDeclaredMethods();
    if(!Arrays.stream(methods).anyMatch(m -> m.isAnnotationPresent(Profiled.class))){
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("interface does not contain a @Profiled method");
    }
    return (T) Proxy.newProxyInstance(
            ProfilerImpl.class.getClassLoader(),
            new Class[]{klass},
            new ProfilingMethodInterceptor(clock, delegate, state));
  }

```

The writeData method takes a Path object as a parameter and writes the profile data to the file located at the specified path. The data is appended to the existing file if it already exists. This method calls the writeData method that takes a Writer object as a parameter.

```java
@Override
public void writeData(Path path) {
    try(Writer writer = Files.newBufferedWriter(path, StandardOpenOption.CREATE, StandardOpenOption.APPEND)) {
        writeData(writer);
    } catch (IOException ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }
}


```

The writeData method takes a Writer object as a parameter and writes the profile data to the writer. It writes the start time of the profiling, followed by the data stored in the state object. The data is written using the write method of the Writer object. A line separator is written before and after the profile data.

```java
@Override
  public void writeData(Writer writer) throws IOException {
    writer.write("Run at " + RFC_1123_DATE_TIME.format(startTime));
    writer.write(System.lineSeparator());
    state.write(writer);
    writer.write(System.lineSeparator());
  }

```
