# Profiler Interface

The code represents an interface Profiler that defines the methods for profiling a given object that should be performance profiled.

The first method wrap takes in a class object of the interface of the delegate object and the delegate object itself. It returns a wrapped version of the delegate object that should be profiled. The interface of the delegate object must have at least one of its methods annotated with the Profiled annotation. If the given delegate object does not have any methods annotated with Profiled, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.

The second method writeData takes in a Path object and writes the formatted profile data as a string to the given path. If the file already exists, new data is appended to it. An IOException is thrown if there is a problem writing the data to the file.

The third method writeData takes in a Writer object and writes the formatted profile data as a string to the given Writer. An IOException is thrown if there is a problem writing the data.

```java
/**
 * A utility that wraps an object that should be performance profiled.
 *
 * <p>The profiler aggregates information about profiled method calls, and how long they took. The
 * aggregate information can then be written to a file with {@link #writeData(Writer) writeData}.
