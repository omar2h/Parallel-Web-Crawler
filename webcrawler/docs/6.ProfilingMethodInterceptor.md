# ProfilingMethodInterceptor 

This is the implementation of a method interceptor class called ProfilingMethodInterceptor, which is responsible for recording the execution time of methods annotated with @Profiled.

This class implements the InvocationHandler interface, which is used to intercept method invocations on a proxy instance.

These instance fields are used to store a reference to a Clock object, a reference to the object being profiled, and a reference to the ProfilingState object that stores the recorded execution times.
```java
final class ProfilingMethodInterceptor implements InvocationHandler {
    private final Clock clock;
    private final Object delegate;
    private final ProfilingState state;

    ProfilingMethodInterceptor(Clock clock, Object delegate, ProfilingState state) {
        this.clock = Objects.requireNonNull(clock);
        this.delegate = Objects.requireNonNull(delegate);
        this.state = Objects.requireNonNull(state);
    }

```

This is the invoke method of the InvocationHandler interface. It is called by the Java runtime whenever a method is invoked on the proxy instance.

It checks whether the invoked method is annotated with @Profiled, and records the start time if it is.

It records the execution time of the method if it is annotated with @Profiled, by calculating the difference between the start and end times and calling the record method of the ProfilingState object.
```java
@Override
public Object invoke(Object proxy, Method method, Object[] args) throws Throwable {
    Object obj = null;
    Instant start = null;
    boolean isProfiled = method.isAnnotationPresent(Profiled.class);
    if(isProfiled) {
    start = clock.instant();
    }

    try {
    obj = method.invoke(delegate, args);
    } catch (IllegalAccessException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    } catch (InvocationTargetException e) {
        throw e.getTargetException();
    } catch(Exception e){
        throw new Exception(e);
    }

    finally {
        if(isProfiled){
        Instant end = clock.instant();
        state.record(delegate.getClass(), method, Duration.between(start, end));
        }
    }
    return obj;

```
